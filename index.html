            <p class="text1">What is css?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
                <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li><br>
                <li><span class="text7">Css is not necessary</span><span class="text4">Css saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <br>
                <li style="font-style: italic;"><a href="">External Stylesheets are stored in Css files.</a></li><br>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="text2">Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2><br>
            <ul class="book">
                <li>Inline - by using the style  attribute inside  HTML  elements1</li>
                <li>Internal - by using a single   element  in the head section</li>
                <li>External -  by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
                <li>The most common way to add css. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span class="text5">in this tutorial we
                    will use inline and internal styles.</span>because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class a style to multiple elements ID, on the other hand
                applies is style to one unique element ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an
                element and it's used by JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>In CSS, Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. 
                once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied in the element.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a wide range of selectors available. Two are most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
                target elements to which a style should be applied.
